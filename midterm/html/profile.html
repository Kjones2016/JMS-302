        <p><em>I am an awesome person to know.  I have many aspirations and will tell you a few!</em></p>

        My goal is to be the best that I can be.  I will not fail at anything I do.  I may get knocked down, but I will get back up.  I want to be a lawyer and will accomplish that goal.  I am also a fun guy to be around.  I race and go <strong>180 mph</strong> on most weekends.
