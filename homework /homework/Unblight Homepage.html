            <h2><i>What is Unblight?</i></h2>
                <p>Like many other cities, our community is in desperate need of repair.  Macon, Georgia. is a community surrounded by many abandoned buildings and houses.  At Unblight.org we are working with Mercer University's Center for Collaborative Journalism, along with the Sunlight Foundation, so we can help make this community whole again.  We are committed to fixing the community, so our wonderful city can once again flourish.</p>
                    <h3><i>Who Can Help?</i></h3>
                        <p>Anyone who is interested in helping the rebuilding process is welcomed to register with us.</p>
